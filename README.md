# MemePlayer.js
MemePlayer.js turns a regular canvas into a full featured meme editor.

### Installation

**Bower**

```
$ bower install memeplayer.js
```

You'll also need to include the [readwrite-gif](https://github.com/ksheedlo/readwrite-gif)
library in your page. Using this
with [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom) and
[node-canvas](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas) is in the roadmap, so
sit tight and don't try to use the NPM module just yet.

### Stuff It Can Do

- Draw text over an image macro.
- Export base64 image data for further processing.
- Works with JPG, PNG and animated GIF (!)

For all the gritty details, refer to the
[API docs](http://ksheedlo.github.io/MemePlayer.js/MemePlayer.html).
